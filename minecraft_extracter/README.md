## Links
- [download](https://legopitstop.weebly.com/minecraft_extracter.html)

## Features
- Saves configuration for the next time you use it.
- Choose to extract the assets or data folders from the jar
- Compile the objects to get access to all sounds, langs, and other hidden assets that aren't in the jar.
- Choose which version to extract using a simple dropdown menu. (may experience some issues if your mc is located in diff folder)
- Optional log output.

## Planned Features
- Add minimize or maximize JSON's.
- Data Generator
- Map Objects: Copy file to new loc instead of moving it, then renaming it. This should fix the duplicate hash files.
- When you close the program, when its running. Properly stop the threads and close the program.
- Cancel button should be renamed to 'Close'. It will then be configured to 'Cancel' when the program is running.
- Window title should also contain the status. "Minecraft Extractor - %s %s" TEXT, FILENAME
- Discovering items progressbar should be the thin bar moving left to right.
